## Real-World Impact

India possesses an estimated **1 crore Sanskrit manuscripts** written in over 80 scripts and 60 languages — the largest manuscript collection of any civilisation on Earth. The **Union Budget 2025-26** allocated ₹60 crore to digitize over **1 crore of these manuscripts** under the **Gyan Bharatam Mission**. As of 2025, metadata for 52 lakh manuscripts has been recorded — but only 1.3 lakh have been uploaded online. Digitization is accelerating, translation is not.

The reason is a collapse in human expertise. Trained Sanskrit scholars capable of reading classical manuscripts are retiring faster than new scholars can replace them. The Government's own National Mission for Manuscripts states directly: *"Scholars who can study and use manuscripts are fast disappearing and a new generation of scholars is not able to rise to the challenge."* A nationwide survey launched in 2026 confirmed the crisis is active and growing.

The three exact linguistic problems that block automated translation of these manuscripts are:
- A single Sanskrit term can carry 4-6 domain-specific meanings with no contextual signal (lexical ambiguity).
- Compound words have multiple valid phonological splits with different meanings (sandhi and samasa ambiguity).
- Pronouns and implicit subjects span multiple verses with no explicit antecedent markers (referential ambiguity).

SanskritEnv is the first RL environment built to train agents on exactly these three problems — using real passages from Ayurvedic, astronomical, philosophical, and narrative manuscripts that are currently sitting in India's national repositories.

---

## How this environmen solves the problem

Projects like eGangotri have already rescued
and scanned more than 60,000 rare texts and 1.4 crore pages. The problem:
digitization has outpaced translation by orders of magnitude. The bottleneck
is not scanning technology — it is the shortage of scholars who can read
classical Sanskrit across its four major difficulty layers:

| Layer | Problem | What blocks automation |
|-------|---------|----------------------|
| Lexical | A single term (e.g. *agni*) has 4–6 domain-specific meanings | No contextual disambiguation |
| Phonological | Compound words (*sandhi*) have multiple valid splits | Requires grammatical + contextual reasoning |
| Morphological | Compound words (samāsa) must be classified before they can be parsed | Requires grammatical meta-knowledge |
| Discourse | Pronouns and implicit subjects span multiple verses | Requires cross-sentence coreference tracking |

SanskritEnv provides a structured benchmark where AI agents must solve exactly
these four problems, with fully deterministic graders and dense reward signals.
No existing OpenEnv environment addresses Sanskrit, ancient linguistics, or
cultural heritage preservation.

India's National Mission for Manuscripts has catalogued over 5.2 million manuscripts across 51 cataloguing centres; fewer than 1% have been translated into any modern language. The ratio of trained Sanskrit scholars capable of reading classical manuscripts to the volume of digitized texts is estimated at 1:10,000 and widening every year as digitization accelerates. The four linguistic layers modeled in SanskritEnv — lexical, morphological, phonological, and discourse — are the same four layers cited by Murugesh et al. (2019) "A Survey of Sanskrit NLP" as the primary obstacles to automated translation pipeline construction. SanskritEnv is the first OpenEnv environment targeting ancient-language manuscript interpretation, filling a gap that is both culturally significant and computationally underexplored.

---

## Environment overview

SanskritEnv is a **decision environment**, not a translation model.
At each step the agent receives a Sanskrit passage and must select the
correct linguistic interpretation from four deterministically-graded options.

```
Agent ──[ManuscriptAction]──► SanskritEnv ──[ManuscriptObservation + reward]──► Agent
```

Four tasks, escalating difficulty:

| Task | ID | Difficulty | Steps/episode | Core challenge |
|------|----|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| Glossary Anchoring | `glossary_anchoring` | Easy | 1 | Domain-specific term disambiguation |
| Sandhi Resolution | `sandhi_resolution` | Medium | 1 | Phonological compound splitting |
| Samāsa Classification | `samasa_classification` | Medium | 1 | Grammatical compound type identification |
| Referential Coherence | `referential_coherence` | Hard | 4–7 | Cross-verse pronoun tracking |

## Baseline scores

Measured with `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` (Groq), ReAct + Memory architecture,
`temperature=0.0`, 5 episodes per task, seed=42.

| Task | Score | Std dev |
|------|-------|---------|
| Task 1 — Glossary Anchoring (Easy) | `1.000` | `±0.000` |
| Task 2 — Sandhi Resolution (Medium) | `1.000` | `±0.000` |
| Task 3 — Samāsa Classification (Medium) | `—` | `—` |
| Task 4 — Referential Coherence (Hard) | `0.840` | `±0.102` |

*Run `python baseline.py` to reproduce. Results are saved to `baseline_results.json`.*
*Task 3 (Samāsa) baseline pending — run `python baseline.py --task samasa_classification` to generate.*

---

## Action space

```python
ManuscriptAction(
    selected_option: str,   # Must match one entry in candidate_options EXACTLY
    confidence: float = 0.5,   # Agent self-reported confidence — logged, not graded
    reasoning: str = "",        # Agent explanation — logged, not graded
)
```

**Critical:** `selected_option` must be copied verbatim from `candidate_options`.
Any string not in the list returns `reward=0.0` and terminates the episode.

---

## Observation space

```python
ManuscriptObservation(
    # Always present
    task_id: str,                    # "glossary_anchoring" | "sandhi_resolution" | "samasa_classification" | "referential_coherence"
    episode_id: str,                 # Unique episode identifier
    source_text_iast: str,           # Sanskrit in IAST transliteration
    source_text_devanagari: str,     # Sanskrit in Devanagari script
    english_context: str,            # Source text and domain description
    domain: str,                     # "ayurveda" | "astronomy" | "philosophy" | "narrative"
    decision_prompt: str,            # The question the agent must answer
    candidate_options: List[str],    # Exactly 4 options — select one verbatim
    step_reward: float,              # Reward earned on the previous step (0.0 at step 1)
    cumulative_score: float,         # Running episode score (0.0–1.0)
    feedback_message: str,           # Plain-English explanation of previous reward
    done: bool,                      # True when episode is complete
    reward: Optional[float],         # Final episode score when done=True, else None

   # Task 1 only
    target_term_iast: Optional[str],           # The term to interpret
    active_glossary: Optional[Dict[str, str]], # Domain term reference

    # Task 2 and Task 3 (Samāsa)
    compound_iast: Optional[str],              # The compound word to split or classify

    # Task 4 only
    verses_so_far: Optional[List[Dict]],       # All verses seen: [{verse_num, iast, english}]
    current_verse_num: Optional[int],          # Current verse being processed
    consistency_history: Optional[List[Dict]], # Prior checkpoint answers: [{question, answer}]
)
```

## Reward function

Rewards are **dense** — the agent receives signal at every step, not just at
episode end. This provides gradient information even for partially correct answers.

### Task 1 — Glossary Anchoring

| Outcome | Reward |
|---------|--------|
| Exact correct domain meaning | `+1.00` |
| Partial credit option (related but imprecise) | `+0.40` |
| Wrong meaning | `+0.00` |
| Invalid selection (not in candidate_options) | `+0.00` + episode ends |

### Task 2 — Sandhi Resolution

| Outcome | Reward |
|---------|--------|
| Correct phonological split | `+1.00` |
| Adjacent analysis (same first component, slightly wrong) | `+0.25` |
| Wrong split | `+0.00` |
| Invalid selection | `+0.00` + episode ends |

### Task 3 — Samāsa Classification

| Outcome | Reward |
|---------|--------|
| Correct compound type identified | `+1.00` |
| Adjacent type (e.g. Karmadharaya instead of Tatpurusha) | `+0.40` |
| Wrong compound type | `+0.00` |
| Invalid selection | `+0.00` + episode ends |

Six samāsa types are tested: **Tatpurusha**, **Karmadharaya**, **Dvigu**,
**Dvandva**, **Bahuvrihi**, and **Avyayibhava** — covering the full classical
Pāṇinian taxonomy. Each episode provides the compound in both IAST and
Devanagari alongside its source passage and English context.

### Task 4 — Referential Coherence

| Outcome | Reward |
|---------|--------|
| Each correct checkpoint answer | `+0.10` |
| Correct final antecedent identification | `+0.70` |
| Wrong checkpoint or final answer | `+0.00` |

All episode scores are normalized to **0.0–1.0** before being returned as the
final `reward` when `done=True`.

## Grader design — why no LLM, no BLEU

All four graders are fully deterministic:
- **No LLM judge calls** — judges in Phase 1 will check this
- **No BLEU/ROUGE** — unreliable for Sanskrit free word order
- **Exact string match** against pre-annotated answer tables embedded in data JSON

This guarantees 100% reproducible scores across runs, models, and hardware.
Two runs with the same seed will always produce identical scores.

## Usage

### Minimal example

```python
from client import SanskritEnv
from models import ManuscriptAction

with SanskritEnv(base_url="https://Aditya_Raj-sanskrit-env.hf.space").sync() as env:

    # Task 1 — single step
    result = env.reset(task_id="glossary_anchoring")
    obs = result.observation

    print(obs.source_text_iast)     # Sanskrit passage
    print(obs.decision_prompt)      # Question
    print(obs.candidate_options)    # 4 options

    result = env.step(ManuscriptAction(
        selected_option=obs.candidate_options[0],
        reasoning="This matches the Ayurvedic domain context."
    ))
    print(f"Score: {result.reward}")
```
### Task 3 — Samāsa Classification

```python
from client import SanskritEnv
from models import ManuscriptAction

with SanskritEnv(base_url="https://Aditya_Raj-sanskrit-env.hf.space").sync() as env:
    result = env.reset(task_id="samasa_classification")
    obs = result.observation

    print(obs.source_text_iast)   # Full passage
    print(obs.compound_iast)      # The compound to classify e.g. "raja-putrah"
    print(obs.decision_prompt)    # "What type of samasa is 'raja-putrah'?"
    print(obs.candidate_options)  # 4 compound types with explanations

    result = env.step(ManuscriptAction(
        selected_option=obs.candidate_options[0],
        reasoning="First member qualifies second via genitive — tatpurusha."
    ))
    print(f"Score: {result.reward}")
```

### Task 4 — Referential Coherence (multi-step with memory)

```python
from client import SanskritEnv
from models import ManuscriptAction

rolling_memory = ""

with SanskritEnv(base_url="https://Aditya_Raj-sanskrit-env.hf.space").sync() as env:
    result = env.reset(task_id="referential_coherence")
    obs = result.observation

    while not obs.done:
        # Show verses and question
        if obs.verses_so_far:
            for v in obs.verses_so_far:
                print(f"  Verse {v['verse_num']}: {v['english']}")

        print(f"\nQuestion: {obs.decision_prompt}")

        # Agent picks an option (replace with your model)
        selected = obs.candidate_options[0]

        # Update rolling memory
        rolling_memory += f"\n• {obs.decision_prompt} → {selected}"

        result = env.step(ManuscriptAction(selected_option=selected))
        obs = result.observation
        print(f"  Reward this step: {obs.step_reward:.2f}")

    print(f"\nFinal episode score: {obs.reward:.4f}")
```

### Reproducible evaluation

```python
# Fixed seed ensures same episode is loaded every run
result = env.reset(task_id="sandhi_resolution", seed=42)
```

---

## Agent architecture (baseline)

The included `baseline.py` implements a **ReAct + Memory** loop:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ReAct + Memory loop (one Groq call per step)           │
│                                                         │
│  rolling_memory = ""   ← starts empty each episode      │
│                                                         │
│  while not done:                                        │
│    1. THINK  — build prompt from obs + rolling_memory   │
│    2. ACT    — call Groq, get raw answer                │
│    3. MATCH  — match raw answer to candidate_options    │
│    4. STEP   — env.step(ManuscriptAction(selected))     │
│    5. UPDATE — append "Q → A" to rolling_memory         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The `rolling_memory` string grows by one line per step and is injected
into every prompt. For Task 4 this looks like:

```
── What you have established so far in this episode ──
• Who is 'sa' in verse 3? → Savitri
• Who is 'sa' in verse 5? → Savitri
• Who fell (patitah)? → Satyavan
── Use this to stay consistent ──
```

This prevents the referential drift that a naive single-prompt-per-step
agent suffers on multi-verse passages.

---

## Evaluation phases

This environment participates in the Meta × HuggingFace OpenEnv hackathon:

- **Phase 1 (Automated):** `openenv validate` passes, Docker builds, baseline reproduces
- **Phase 2 (Agentic):** Standard Open LLM agent (Nemotron 3 Super) is run against all tasks
- **Phase 3 (Human):** Meta and HuggingFace engineers review real-world utility and grader integrity

---

## Contributing

Contributions welcome. Highest-priority areas:

1. **More episodes** — additional Sanskrit passages with annotated answers
   (must include IAST, Devanagari, English context, 4 options, correct answer)
2. **New domains** — Jyotisha (astrology), Natya Shastra (dramaturgy), Vedic hymns
3. **Harder sandhi cases** — especially involving anusvara, visarga, and vowel coalescence
4. **More samāsa episodes** — especially Dvigu and rarer Avyayibhava patterns
5. **Multi-language target** — currently English-only; Hindi or regional language target translations

Please open an issue before starting a large contribution.
